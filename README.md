# helpinghands
This is a sample website created as a hobby project by me.
The website is called helping hands.It is a website developed exclusively for NGOs.
The backup folder contains all the code for the webpages,stylesheets and js.It also contains php code and images.
For the php code to work we have to use localhost or xamppserver.
This project was done using xampp.
